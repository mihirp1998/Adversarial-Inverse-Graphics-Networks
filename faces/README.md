the code isn't well structured at all.. 
But you guys can use the specific python files to run the version of dataset that you are using for faces..
there isn't a global config file right now.. so u would have to manually change the dataset directory within the python file

Also i have the pretrained models available with me right now so  if at all you need it.. please feel free to mail me
